# Contributing

Contributing to stonks requires very little. The only thing I require is to create a branch and open PRs to Master. Follow proper coding style. I recommend using python Black.

  * clone: `git clone https://github.com/georgefahmy/stonks.git`
  * read the README.md
  * create a user branch `git checkout -b user/<username>/<description>`
  * create a PR on github to merge to master.

### Coding conventions
Write good code. Dont write bad code.

Thanks,
George Fahmy, Professional Stonker
